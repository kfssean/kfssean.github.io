     <h1>Playing a Concert</h1>
     <p>Playing a concert can be great fun! Or it can be totally scary! Sometimes both at the same time</p>
     <p>So we've put together a list of our top tips for great concerts.</p>
     <h2>Copy out a set-list</h2>
     <p>A <strong>set-list</strong> is a list of all your songs in the order you'll play them.</p>
     <p>Make copies for everyone</p>
     <p>Print it <strong>BIG!</strong> so that you can still read it if it's down by your feet on the floor or if the lighting isn't very good.</p>
     <h2>Remember your spares.</h2>
     <p>Some instruments have parts that need to the replaced if they wear out or beak. For example:</p>
     <ul>
     	<li>guitar strings</li>
        <li>saxophone or clarinet reeds</li>
        <li>drumsticks</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Make a list of spares you might need and make sure you know where they are in an emergency</p>
     <p>Plan where you'll be on the stage.</p>
     <p>Before you start to set up the instruments, take a few minutes to decide where you're all going to be.</p>
     </ul>

     	<p>Before you start to set up the instruments, take a few minutes to decide where you're all going to be.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Will the druns be center stage? or off to one side?</li> 
        <li>Is there a power-socket for the amplifier if your guitar player stands on the right?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's much better to think about all this <strong>before</strong> you start setting up your instruments. It's really annoying if you have to start unplugging things and swapping places once you've begun to set things up!</p>
        <h2>Know where you're going, know when you're on</h2>
        <p>If you're playing a concert somewhere you've never been before make sure you know where it is. Pirnt out a map or you're due to go-onstage.</p>
        <p>And when you do arrive, the first thing you should do is <strong>find out what time you're on</strong>. On the night times often change. Ask whoever is running the event when you'll be on. Don't get caught out!</p>
